          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create the structure of the webpage
              <ul>
                <li>It usually includes text elements, image elements, header elements, and list elements</li>
                <li>HTML elements work together and provide the main framework for the end user to navigate a webpage</li>
                <li>HTML elements have opening and closing tags using angle brackets (< >)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users</li>
              </ul>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
            <li>The head and meta tags are invvisible to the end user</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>The one excpetion to this is the browser's title bar or a page's tab</li>
              </ul>
            <li>HTML attriubtes alwyays defined in beginning element, never the closing element</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>The space in between the HTML opening and closing tab is what defines the entire structure of a website</li>
                  <li>For more in depth list of tags, Go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_li.asp">Tag Lists</a> </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                You can easily create a skeleton HTML file that has some basic written code in VSS by:
                <ul>
                  <li>Creating a new index.html file</li>
                  <li>Go to the search bar at the top</li>
                  <li>Type in a single "!" and hit enter</li>
                  <li>The context menu should automatically show the code in the browser before you click on it anyways</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            CSS is a programming language used to define how a webpage content is presented to the user
            <ul>
              <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
              <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using different style options</li>
              <li>Three major ways to style a webpage</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Inline css-section</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, it is called inline css-section</li>
                  <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag using style attribute with a CSS rule</li>
                  <li>Useful for quick and permanent changes but less flexible than external or internal style sheets</li>
                  <li>Actually possible to embed an entire stylesheet in the HTML file</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal style sheets</strong> contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Rules will only apply to that page and are able to configure CSS classes and IDs</li>
                      <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>External style sheets</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>An external CSS file is linked to the HTML file using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the head section</li>
                  <li>Allows for centralized styling across multiple HTML files</li>
                  <li>Keeps all CSS rules in a seperate file, making it easier to change designs</li>
                  <li>Modifications in the external CSS file will affect all linked HTML files</li>
                  <li>Enables easy maintenance and separation of concerns between HTML and CSS</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Imported style sheets</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Similar to external style sheets, imported style sheets are linked to the HTML file but using the <code>@import</code> rule in a style block</li>
                  <li>Imported CSS files are loaded after the main CSS file and can override styles</li>
                  <li>Provides flexibility to include different CSS files based on specific conditions or requirements</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </ul>

My notes use 'ul' and 'li' for indenting purposes, but I find it still tricky to go back and add a section without messing up the format.

        <h2>GIT + GITHUB</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Git (Global Information Tracker) is a version control system that keeps track of all versions of your project
            <ul>
              <li>Git is great for tracking local changes on your PC</li>
              <li>It is installed locally on your computer and lets you open a terminal (CLI) called bash/git bash</li>
              <li>Can be used to clone, create new branches, switch to different branches (called "checkout"), etc.</li>
              <li>Refer to the Git Command Cheat Sheet for some common commands to use
                <ul>
                  <li>git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.</li>
                  <li>git clone &lt;repository&gt;: Copies a repository from a remote source to your local machine.</li>
                  <li>git add &lt;file&gt;: Adds a file to the staging area to be included in the next commit.</li>
                  <li>git commit -m "message": Creates a new commit with the changes in the staging area and adds a commit message.</li>
                  <li>git push: Uploads local commits to a remote repository.</li>
                  <li>git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.</li>
                  <li>git branch: Lists all branches in the repository.</li>
                  <li>git checkout &lt;branch&gt;: Switches to a different branch.</li>
                  <li>git merge &lt;branch&gt;: Merges changes from a specified branch into the current branch.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Can be connected to a Github repo for version control and can push, pull, merge, pull and more to the chosen Github repository
                <ul>
                  <li>Must first establish SSH keys from your local machine and connect them to your Github account online</li>
                  <li>Can be difficult to establish so please refer to the Bootcamp's instructions as well as on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">Github's official documents</a> </li>
                  <li>Also, it's important to make sure that you are always connected to your Github account using:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>git status: show modified filed in your working directory, staged for next commit</li>
                    <li>git config --list: Shows current settings from the config file</li>
                    <li>git config user.name: displays current registered username</li>
                    <li>git config user.email: shows current registered email</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>A Git local environment refers to your own computer or development machine where you have a local copy of a Git repo.
                <ul>
                  <li>Essentially the environment where you do Git operations and make changes to your codebase</li>
                  <li>Open your Git repo through the CLI and then launch the repo with the command "code ." to open it in Visual Studio Code</li>
                  <li>It's a safe space to test code without touching the online Github repo. Once your code is tested, it can then be pushed to the main Github repo (preferably as a separate branch AND NOT the main branch)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Github is a cloud-based hosting service that lets us keep track of repositories (or "repo's")
            <ul>
              <li>Similar to Git but via the cloud</li>
              <li>Allows collaboration from multiple individuals for version control and is paramount towards the Agile method in a corporate setting
                <ul>
                  <li>Agile principles lead to flexibility, customer satisfaction, and efficient software development.</li>
                  <li>Some of the key principles:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Iterative and incremental development in small cycles (iterations/sprints)</li>
                      <li>Continuous collaboration between teams, stakeholders, and end-users</li>
                      <li>Customer-centric approach, prioritizing their needs and incorporating feedback</li>
                      <li>Embracing change and adapting plans and requirements as necessary</li>
                      <li>Self-organizing cross-functional teams taking collective responsibility</li>
                      <li>Focus on continuous improvement through retrospectives</li>
                      <li>Popular frameworks: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Gives you the ability to create an online repo which can be private or public and lets you continue your work without having to be tied down to the same PC workstation.
                    <ul>
                      <li>I do believe creating new SSH keys is needed on each PC workstation so that you can be connected to your Github account from the git bash terminal</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>README files are used to pass along useful information to anyone who visits the repo on github</li>
                  <li>Licenses are also needed for each repo, especially if they're public because it lets others know what can be done with the repo legally.</li>
                  <li>Github offers a task management tool called Github issues</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Git and Github branching
                <ul>
                  <li>Default branch is usually called main or master</li>
                  <li>NEVER DO CODING IN THE MAIN BRANCH!!!</li>
                  <li>Instead, create a separate branch off of the main branch for code testing
                    <ul>
                      <li>Feature branches is what they are usually called but can be called other names at user discretion</li>
                      <li>Do this via the Git terminal. Terminal command for it is in the cheat sheet and on the bootcamp module with further instructions</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working. Here is a general rundown of what to do in the Gitbash terminal
                    <ol type="i">
                      <li>Create a feature branch:
                        <ol>
                          <li>git branch feature-branch</li>
                          <li>git checkout feature-branch</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>Then make changes in your local environment (work on your code, modify files, etc.)</li>
                      <li>Stage the changes
                        <ol>
                          <li>git add file1.js file2.js (this is just an example and not actual file names)</li>
                          <li>To stage an entire directory, do 'git add .'</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>Commit the changes
                        <ol>
                          <li>Git commit -m "Implement feature XYZ"</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>Repeat steps iii-iv while continuing to make changes, staging them, and creating commits as needed</li>
                      <li>Push the changes
                        <ol>
                          <li>When you're ready to share with others, use the following command below to push your commits</li>
                          <li>Git push origin feature-branch</li>
                          <li>The push will be sent to the github repo where you will create what is called a "pull request". Other members in the team will review your pull request. Once the branch is reviewed and accepted, it will merge into the main branch.</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>You might be wondering what are commits and pushing because I for sure was confused
                    <ul>
                      <li>Commits capture a specific state of the codebase at a given point in time
                        <ul>
                          <li>Each commit is unique with its own identifier, commit messages, any references to parent commit(s).</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Commits show a linear or branching history, showing the progress of the codebase over time</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>How often do you do commits?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Varies from person to person and from project to project</li>
                      <li>Common practices:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Granularity
                            <ul>
                              <li>Commits should represent logical units of work. It's generally recommended to make commits that encapsulate a cohesive set of changes related to a specific task or feature. This ensures that each commit is focused and makes it easier to understand the history of changes.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>Regularly
                            <ul>
                              <li>It's good practice to make commits regularly rather than accumulating a large number of changes before committing. Regular commits help in maintaining a clear history, facilitate collaboration, and allow for easier rollback if necessary.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>Milestones or Completed Features
                            <ul>
                              <li>Sometimes made when huge changes such as implementing new features. A sort of checkpoint status as you will.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>Atomic changes
                            <ul>
                              <li>A commit represents a single conceptual change. If a change spans multiple files or modifications, it's recommended to split them into separate commits for clarity and easier tracking.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>Continuous Integration/Deployment
                            <ul>
                              <li>Commits trigger automated processes like builds, tests, and deployments. In such cases, making commits more frequently, ideally after each completed task or code change, can help in ensuring smooth integration and continuous delivery.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Well, what about Staging? What is that?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Staging is necessary and must be done before making a commit.</li>
                      <li>Well not necessary, but it ensures that the properly selected files are committed instead of the entire repo</li>
                      <li>Staging allows you to selectively choose which changes you want to include in your next commit
                        <ul>

                      </li>
                      <li>If staging isn't done, if you ran the "git commit" command, Git would commit all of the modified files in your local repo by default.</li>
                      <li>Can be VERY problematic if you accidentally committed other files that were not ready to be committed yet</li>
                      <li>Staging is the safeguard against accidentally committing unintended changes and gives developers the ability to consciously curate the contents of each commit.</li>

        <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Javascript is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Javascript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive.</li>
          <li>Some JavaScript use cases:
            <ul>
              <li>Update displayed data behind the scenes.</li>
              <li>Display or use a timer.</li>
              <li>Validate user input and show error messages + attach error styles to elements.</li>
              <li>Display and manage complex overlays.</li>
              <li>Re-order, hide/show, or remove elements on the screen.</li>
              <li>Keep (parts of) websites working, even if the internet connection is lost.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Core Syntax:
            <ul>
              <li>&#40;Syntax is just the "grammar" of a programming language, or the rules of it.&#41;</li>
              <li>1.&#41;Variables and Values.</li>
              <li>2.&#41;Arrays and Objects.</li>
              <li>3.&#41;Functions.</li>
              <li>4.&#41;Working with the "DOM".</li>
              <li>5.&#41;Control Structures.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Values:
            <ul>
              <li>Text values in JavaScript are called "String" values.</li>
              <li>Number values are also important.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Variables:
            <ul>
              <li>Variables are "labeled data containers" called "var" in syntax.</li>
              <li>JavaScript code can use either single or double quotes. Be consistent and use one or the other (i.e., "" or '').</li>
              <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon (;).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script:
            <ul>
              <li>JavaScript code runs from the first statement at the top of the page down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
              <li>This means you must be intentional about where you write code in the JavaScript file!</li>
              <li>Conditional statements and loops control the order in which code is executed or if it is even executed at all.</li>
              <li>Using conditional statements allows us to interrupt the control flow, thus bypassing this limitation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Conditional statements:
            <ul>
              <li>Such as "if-else" or "switch," enable you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false.</li>
              <li>An "if" statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
              <li>In JavaScript, the coding language will check to see if a condition we provide is truthy.</li>
              <li>If it is, then it will do whatever action we asked it to do between the curly brackets.</li>
              <li>If the condition is not truthy, then JavaScript will ignore what's written in the curly brackets.</li>
              <li>Falsy statements are defined by the values: 0, -0, On, " ", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
              <li>We can add more conditions to if statements by using "else if".</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Loops:
            <ul>
              <li>Enable you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times.</li>
              <li>There are different types of loops, such as "for," "while," and "do-while".</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Arrays:
            <ul>
              <li>Stores a group of related data in a variable and uses a "for" loop to perform a task on each piece of data.</li>
              <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
              <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
              <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to know the location of the data in the array. The location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>"For" loops:
            <ul>
              <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
              <li>It has three main statements:
                <ul>
                  <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.</li>
                  <li>The second statement is the condition.</li>
                  <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Functions:
            <ul>
              <li>A set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
              <li>Functions are different from for loops and conditional statements because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run.</li>
              <li>You must call a function to execute it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Refer to this <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types'>references</a> page for more in-depth syntax knowledge on JavaScript.</li>
