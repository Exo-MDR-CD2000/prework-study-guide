# <Personal Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This study guide was made as introductory towards the world of web development (and towards full stack development as well). It contains notes for HTML, CSS, Git + Github, and Javascript. A simple webpage was created to display the notes took during the prework segment of the course. Besides the ovbious answer of it beign homeweok, it did solidify the three fundamentals of web development. This little activity took me several days, but I honestly enjoyed building this from the ground up (well as much as I could). My god awful written notes are on display for all to see.
